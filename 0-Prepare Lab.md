# Task 1. IBM Cloud registration

Before you can run all the labs, you should prepare your environment to execute those labs.

Labs are running on the **IBM Cloud** (ex Bluemix).

So before you can start any labs, you should have satisfied the following prerequisites :
- [ ] You should have **1 valid email** 
- [ ] Sign up to the **IBM Cloud** 

Here are some helpful steps :

### Sign in to IBM Cloud
If you don't have already registered to **IBM Cloud**,  
Open this link  [IBM Cloud](http://bluemix.net) or type http://bluemix.net in your favorite internet browser.


![Create your Lite Account](./images/a001.png)

### Fill in the form
Specify last name, first name, corp, country, phone number and password.
> By **default**, all new people that register to IBM Cloud will have an **Lite Account** with **no time restriction**. This is not a 30 day trial account. 

Click on **Create Account** button. 
![Register to IBM Cloud](./images/a002.png)

![Thanks](./images/a003.png)


### Confirm your registration to IBM Cloud from your inbox
From your email application, confirm the account creation.

![Confirm Account](./images/a004.png)

Log in to IBM Cloud with your credentials :

![Success Sign up](./images/a005.png)


# Task 2. Apply a promo code (if necessary)

Check if you can access to **Containers in Kubernetes Clusters**.
To do so, click on **Catalog** and click on **Containers** on the left pane of the page :


![Showing Containers](./images/showcontainers.png)

> **IMPORTANT** : If you just see **Container Registry** and not the Containers in Kubernetes Clusters, then **you will need a promo code !!!**

> **IMPORTANT** : If you don't have a **promo code**, then ask IBM during the workshop. You can continue the other steps of this preparation and come back later to this step. However, to create a cluster, you will need a promo code.

To install a promo code, follow the procedure : 

Go to **Manage > Billing and Usage > Billing** and press enter.


![Billing](./images/billing.png)

You should get the following section in the billing page  :

![promocode](./images/promocode.png)

Click **Apply Code** button.


![type your Promo Code](./images/applycode.png)

Enter your **promo code** and click **Apply** 

![Apply Promo Code](./images/applypromo2.png)

> Close this window and **logout / login** to your account.

Go back to the **Catalog** and check that now you have access to **Containers in Kubernetes Clusters** and the Container Registry.

![Kubernetes](./images/kcheck.png)

# Task 3. Install Docker CE on your Mac

> This step is mandatory if you want to go thru **Docker and Kubernetes labs**

Follow this procedure to install the latest Docker Community Edition on your Mac (**for Windows**, jump to the next session) 

Docker CE for Mac is free to download.

https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac

![Docker for Mac](./images/dockermac.png)

Install it (click on the blue button **Get Docker**)

Double-click **Docker.dmg** to start the install process.

When the installation completes and Docker starts, the whale in the top status bar shows that Docker is running, and accessible from a terminal.

![Docker for Mac is ready](./images/install2docker.png)

Open a terminal and type :

`docker version`

You should see something similar to this screen :
```console
phil:[node]: docker version
Client:
 Version:      18.03.1-ce
 API version:  1.37
 Go version:   go1.9.5
 Git commit:   9ee9f40
 Built:        Thu Apr 26 07:13:02 2018
 OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64
 Experimental: false
 Orchestrator: swarm

Server:
 Engine:
  Version:      18.03.1-ce
  API version:  1.37 (minimum version 1.12)
  Go version:   go1.9.5
  Git commit:   9ee9f40
  Built:        Thu Apr 26 07:22:38 2018
  OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
  Experimental: true

```
> Note that you should always have the client and the server running.

> The Docker server contains the **Docker engine**(containerd) that controls running containers. 


# Task 4. Install Docker CE on Windows

> This step is mandatory if you want to go thru **Docker and Kubernetes labs.**


Follow this procedure to install the latest Docker Community Edition on Windows (for Mac, jump to the previous session) 

Docker CE for Windows is free to download.

https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows

![Docker for Windows](./images/dockerwin.png)

Leave the default parameters: 

![Docker for Windows](./images/dockerwindows2.png)

After download, install Docker CE

**Double-click Docker for Windows Installer** to run the installer.

> **IMPORTANT**: During the installation process, you may be informed the installer will reboot your workstation to install the virtualization feature of your PC. 


When the installation finishes, Docker starts automatically. The **whale** in the notification area indicates that Docker is running, and accessible from a terminal.

Open a command-line terminal like PowerShell, and try out some Docker commands!

Run docker version to check the version.

`docker version`

You should see something similar to this screen :
```console
phil:[node]: docker version
Client:
 Version:      18.03.1-ce
 API version:  1.37
 Go version:   go1.9.5
 Git commit:   9ee9f40

  Built:        Thu Apr 26 07:22:38 2018
  OS/Arch:      Windows/amd64
  Experimental: true

```
> Note that you should always have the client and the server running.

> The Docker server contains the **Docker engine**(containerd) that controls running containers. 

# Task 5. Install Git on your laptop

To do so : 

For MacOS :
http://mac.github.com

For Windows: 
http://git-scm.com/download/win

At some point during the installation, change to the **"Use Windows default console"** and continue the installation.
![Git for Windows](./images/git2.png)

# Task 6. Install the ibmcloud command

The **ibmcloud** command line interface (CLI) provides a set of commands that are grouped by namespace for users to interact with IBM Cloud. In previous versions, the name of that command was "bluemix" or "bx".

You install a set of IBM® Cloud developer tools, verify the installation, and configure your environment. IBM® Cloud developer tools offer a command-line approach to creating, developing, and deploying end-to-end web, mobile, and microservice applications.

With this installation, you get the stand-alone IBM Cloud CLI, plus the following tools:

Homebrew (Mac only)
Git
Docker
Helm
kubectl
curl
IBM Cloud Developer Tools plug-in
IBM Cloud Functions plug-in
IBM Cloud Container Registry plug-in
IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service plug-in
sdk-gen plug-in

For MacOS or Linux:
`curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash`

For Windows in PowerShell : 
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted; iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ibm.biz/idt-win-installer')
```


Results:

```console

# Task 7. Login to IBM Cloud

 Login to IBM Cloud with the ic command :

 `ibmcloud login -a api.eu-gb.bluemix.net`

 And answer a few questions: email, password, account, 

 ```console 
$ ibmcloud login -a api.eu-gb.bluemix.net
API endpoint: api.eu-gb.bluemix.net

Email> philmetal@mail.com

Password> 
Authenticating...
OK

Targeted account rock metal (4d327e6ba61d02089dab9af842d267c9)
Targeted resource group Default
                     
API endpoint:     https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net (API version: 2.92.0)   
Region:           eu-gb   
User:             philmetal@mail.com   
Account:          rock metal (4d327e6ba61d02089dab9af842d267c9)   
Resource group:   Default   
Org:                 
Space:               

Tip: If you are managing Cloud Foundry applications and services
- Use 'ic target --cf' to target Cloud Foundry org/space interactively, or use 'ic target -o ORG -s SPACE' to target the org/space.
- Use 'ic cf' if you want to run the Cloud Foundry CLI with current IBM Cloud CLI context.

​````

And optionally, you can also specify the following ORG and SPACE with that command :

`ibmcloud target --cf`

Results:
​```console
# ibmcloud target --cf
Targeted Cloud Foundry (https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net)

Targeted org philament@mail.com

Targeted space dev
                      
API endpoint:      https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net   
Region:            eu-gb   
User:              philament@mail.com   
Account:           philament corp (022bbfb763d37397d0dfd18217c33c6c)   
Resource group:    Default   
CF API endpoint:   https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net (API version: 2.106.0)   
Org:               philament@mail.com   
Space:             dev     

 ```

Or you can also use :

`ibmcloud target -o <value> -s <value>`

Where -o is your **email** and -s is the **dev** space.
